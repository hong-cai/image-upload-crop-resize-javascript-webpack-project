## Introduction
- This repository serves as part of a Big-commerce project to allow uses to upload their own photos to match a suitable product photoframe and .

- This graphic design project is only the front end part to a whole project for displaying my profile, using Webpack to compile the .scss files to css and bundle .js files. For back-end I use PHP MVC framework to display dynamic contents from MySQL database. [Backend PHP MVC framework](https://github.com/hong-cai/php-MVC-panel-adminLTE-bootstrap-javascript)

- The design of this colorful profile page used 5 colors,which is more than designing a typical website. The purpose of that was to create a 'Game Style Theme' that displays bright eye-catching effect to the readers.
- This page design is fully responsive that adapts easily across most devices.
